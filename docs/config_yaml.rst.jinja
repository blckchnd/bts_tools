Format of the config.yaml file
==============================

The ``config.yaml`` file is the file where you configure the tools to match your environment.
It is located in ``~/.bts_tools/config.yaml``. If you properly fill in
all the values in it, there is no need for you to edit anything in the data-dir of the witness
client (ie: no config.ini editing) and the tools can manage everything from the command line.
This allows you to keep all the information in one single file, much easier to manage.

Instead of going over all the parameters in an arbitrary order and explaining them, we will
just show a working example file that is fully commented and serves as the reference documentation.

Please make sure that you fully understand some :doc:`core_concepts` before proceeding.

Also know that there are a lot of other options under the hood, but in order to not be overwhelming,
those have default values and are contained in a bigger config.yaml file. At startup, your config file is merged into it
before being used by the application. If you want to see the full configuration file generated from it,
it is located in ``~/.bts_tools/full_config.yaml``

And now, without further ado, here is the reference ``config.yaml`` file:


.. _config-yaml-file:

config.yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

{{ config_yaml }}


minimal config.yaml
-------------------

Here's a minimally useful version of ``config.yaml`` that will build and run a BitShares seed node.

.. code-block:: yaml
